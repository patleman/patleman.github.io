I am an aspiring robotics software engineer with a Master's degree in Robotics from NYU Tandon School of Engineering and a Bachelor's degree from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University, India. I am currently seeking opportunities in robotics software engineering, with a focus on control systems.

Currently, I am working as a research intern at Gen Auto AI, a startup, where I design control laws for safety-critical autonomous systems.

In addition to this, I have hands-on experience implementing these control laws on real-world manipulators, such as the UR16e and Franka Emika.

Iâ€™ve also worked with drones running on PX4 software during my time at Omnipresent Robot Tech, a robotics startup in New Delhi. This work has given me exposure to various robotic systems and has helped me develop practical skills in the field.
 
 
During my master's coursework, subjects like Robot Localization and Navigation, and Perception have equipped me with a solid foundation in algorithms for localization and mapping, enabling me to apply these concepts in real-world robotic systems.


My current project is on developing safety-prioritized control laws in optimized control settings, where multiple constraints are dynamically prioritized and adapt to changing conditions. To enable this, I am exploring learning strategies to adjust the priority levels of constraints in real time.

I am particularly excited by the opportunity to work with real-world robotic systems, where I can apply theoretical concepts in optimization, control, and computer vision. By leveraging established frameworks, an analytical mindset, and advanced coding skills, I am driven to make a meaningful contribution to the field of robotics.

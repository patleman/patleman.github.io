I am an aspiring robotics software engineer with a Master's degree in Robotics from NYU Tandon School of Engineering and a Bachelor's degree from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University, India. I am currently seeking opportunities in robotics software engineering, with a focus on control systems.

Currently, I am working as a research intern at Gen Auto AI, a startup, where I design control laws for safety-critical autonomous systems. My primary focus is on developing safety-prioritized control laws in optimized control settings, where multiple constraints are dynamically prioritized and adapt to changing conditions. To enable this, I am exploring learning strategies to adjust the priority levels of constraints in real time.

In addition to my work in control laws, I have hands-on experience implementing them on real-world manipulators, such as the UR16e and Franka Emika. Iâ€™ve also worked with drones running PX4 source code during my time at Omnipresent Robot Tech, a robotics startup in New Delhi. This work has given me exposure to various robotic systems and has helped me develop practical skills in the field.

During my master's coursework, subjects like Robot Localization and Navigation, and Perception have equipped me with a solid foundation in algorithms for localization and mapping, enabling me to apply these concepts in real-world robotic systems.

What excites me most is the opportunity to work on real-life robotic systems, where I can bring the theoretical aspects of optimization, control, and computer vision to life. By leveraging established frameworks, an algorithmic mindset, and strong coding skills, I am motivated to make a tangible impact in the field of robotics.

### Omnipresent Robot Tech, India, Robotics Software Engineer | India
*Sept 2020 - Sept 2021*
- Improved the security, traceability, and integrity of the company's Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) by augmenting the open-source software **PX4** with **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** to meet Indian regulatory requirements.
- The aforementioned augmentation was directly applied to the PX4 source code (Pixhawk), which had previously been implemented on a Raspberry Pi (companion computer), thereby **increasing the flight time** and **reducing the power consumption** of the company's RPAS.
- Developed and documented the company's [**NPNT (No Permission, No Take-off)**](https://patleman.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-4/) architecture to ensure compliance with Indian regulations.

### Industrial Automation Lab (MPAE Department, NSIT), R&D Intern | New Delhi, India
*Jun 2019 - Sept 2019*
- Worked on a project titled, **"Quaternion based estimation and disturbance observer-based control of attitude for a quadrotor"** in the requirement of the Internship.
- Simulated **disturbance-rejection-based PID** attitude control on a quadrotor using **MATLAB**.
- Executed **Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter** for estimating orientation of quadrotor from noisy sensor measurements.

title: "Pose and Linear Velocity Estimation of a Drone Using Onboard Downfacing Camera and IMU (UKF Implementation)"
excerpt: " This project demonstrates the fusion of sensor data from an IMU and a camera to estimate the pose and linear velocity of a drone. This is achieved by leveraging principles of computer vision and state estimation, including homography matrix estimation, FAST feature detection, KLT tracking for optical flow, RANSAC for outlier rejection, and the Unscented Kalman Filter.<br/> <img src='/images/optical_flow_drone.gif'>"
